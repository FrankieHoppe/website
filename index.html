                    Hi I'm <strong>Frankie</strong> and this is my Test Portfolio Website made with GitHub Pages. I wrote the the .html and .css for this website
                    myself. This is a place to practice my website skills which frankly are not that great at the moment.
                    I hope to fill this website with life and more and more things step by step. Maybe next time you visit there will be new thing here to look at. 
                    üôÉ That would be so cool!
                </p>
